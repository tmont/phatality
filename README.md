# Phatality

This is a (very) old attempt at writing a PHP ORM in the
style and spirit of Hibernate. I got about 5% done
before it stopped being fun. This was imported from my old Subversion
server in March 2015.

This was purely an academic exercise, and didn't really have any 
intentions of making it a real piece of software. It was mostly
for my own benefit to see what it would take to build something
like this.
